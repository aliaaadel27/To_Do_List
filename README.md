To-Do List with JavaScript, a simple yet fully functional to-do list application built as part of the Web Masters Frontend Internship. This project showcases key front-end development skills,
including building responsive layouts, implementing core functionality with JavaScript, and persisting user data using localStorage.

Project Overview
This project is designed to help users manage tasks efficiently, offering a smooth user experience and interactive design. Users can add, delete, and edit tasks,
as well as mark them as completed. The tasks persist in the browser even after a reload, thanks to localStorage.

Technical Requirements
The project was built from scratch using the following tools and technologies:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML5: For structuring the content of the page.
CSS3: For styling and ensuring the layout is visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript (ES6+): To implement the functionality, interactions, and data handling.
No External Libraries or Frameworks: The application uses only vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
Flexbox/Grid Layouts: For structuring the UI in a responsive and flexible manner.
